## Configure the Infrastructure

A set of scripst, templates, Ansible playbooks etc. to configure a Raspberry Pi and other infrastructure.

**DO NOT** store any secrets, certificates, API keys in the source code repository ! Add them as templates, without any secret 
stuff and make sure the real files are excluded from git by adding them to `.gitignore` !
